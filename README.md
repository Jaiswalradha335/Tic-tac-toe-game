Tic Tac Toe Game



This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns and marks their moves with 'X' 
and 'O'. The first player to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins 
the game otherwise the game will drop.
